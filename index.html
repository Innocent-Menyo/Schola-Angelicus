    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>At Schola Angelica, we are committed to changing lives through music. Our charity provides underprivileged youth with the opportunity to learn and master a variety of musical instruments, including piano, cello, violin, guitar, and organ. We believe that music can be a powerful tool for empowerment, self-expression, and a pathway to brighter futures.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to offer quality music education to children and young adults who face financial barriers to formal education. By providing free training in these instruments, we open doors for youth to explore their musical talents and develop skills that will serve them for life. Beyond music training, we also connect our students with global opportunities and local employment options, helping them thrive as professional musicians and build sustainable careers in the arts.</p>
        <p>In a world where unemployment is a pressing issue and the formal sector is already oversaturated, many youth from disadvantaged backgrounds struggle to afford tuition for higher education. We strive to provide an alternative route to success through music, offering not only artistic growth but a potential livelihood.</p>
        <p>With the support of dedicated mentors, donors, and partners, we aim to bridge the gap, offering our students the tools they need to succeed in music and in life. Together, we can create a community where talent, perseverance, and opportunity are within reach for every young person, regardless of their background.</p>
